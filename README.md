## Overview
This project utilizes Power BI to create an interactive dashboard analyzing Airbnb data in New York City. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects of Airbnb bookings, including the popularity of neighborhoods, average booking prices, top hosts, total reviews over time, and the distribution of room types.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the NYC Airbnb dataset, which contains detailed information about Airbnb listings, including location, price, host information, and reviews. The dataset allows us to explore trends and patterns in Airbnb bookings across different neighborhoods in New York City.

## Features
### 1. Neighborhood Bookings
- Visualizes which neighborhoods in New York City have the highest number of bookings.
- Allows users to explore booking trends and popularity across different areas.

### 2. Average Booking Price
- Displays the average booking price per night in each neighborhood.
- Helps users understand the pricing dynamics across different parts of the city.

### 3. Top Hosts
- Identifies the top hosts based on the number of listings or bookings.
- Provides insights into the most influential hosts in the Airbnb ecosystem.

### 4. Total Reviews by Month
- Tracks the total number of reviews over time, allowing users to identify seasonal trends and fluctuations in demand.

### 5. Room Type Distribution
- Analyzes the distribution of room types (e.g., entire home/apartment, private room, shared room) per booking.
- Helps users understand the preferences of Airbnb guests in terms of accommodation type.
